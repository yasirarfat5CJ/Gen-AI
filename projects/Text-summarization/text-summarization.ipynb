Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = ( z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2'),\n",

Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors.

The input consists of\\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q.

We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q, K, V ) = softmax( QK T\\n√dk\\n)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof 1√dk\\n. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1√dk\\n.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\\nqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\\n4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of q and k are independent random\\nvariables with mean 0 and variance 1.

With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.\\nMultiHead(Q, K, V ) = Concat(head 1, ..., headh)W O\\nwhere headi = Attention(QW Q\\ni , KW K\\ni , V W V\\ni )\\nWhere the projections are parameter matricesW Q\\ni ∈ Rdmodel×dk, W K\\ni ∈ Rdmodel×dk, W V\\ni ∈ Rdmodel×dv\\nand W O ∈ Rhdv×dmodel.\\nIn this work we employ h = 8 parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0 , xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512 , and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndf f = 2048.\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n5'),\n",

To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nP E(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel)\\nP E(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel)\\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k, P Epos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nP Epos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈ Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\n6'),\n",

To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in\\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\nor O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [ 18], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5 Training\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1 Training Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3 Optimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [20] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ = 10 −9. We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate = d−0.5\\nmodel · min(step_num−0.5, step_num · warmup_steps−1.5) (3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup_steps training steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup_steps = 4000.\\n5.4 Regularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\n7'),\n",

      "sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\n",
      "states ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\n",
      "sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\n",
      "sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\n",
      "significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\n",
      "computation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\n",
      "constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\n",
      "Attention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\n",
      "tion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\n",
      "the input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\n",
      "are used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\n",
      "In this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\n",
      "relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\n",
      "The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\n",
      "translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\n",
      "2 Background\n",
      "The goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\n",
      "[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\n",

      "Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\n",

      "3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\n",
      "Encoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two\n",
      "sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\n",

      "LayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\n",
      "itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\n",

      "Decoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two\n",
      "sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\n",
      "attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\n",
      "around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\n",
      "sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\n",
      "masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\n",
      "predictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\n",
      "3.2 Attention\n",
      "An attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\n",

The best\\nperforming models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention\\nmechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer,\\nbased solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions\\nentirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to\\nbe superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly\\nless time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-\\nto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including\\nensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task,\\nour model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after\\ntraining for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the\\nbest models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to\\nother tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with\\nlarge and limited training data.\\n∗Equal contribution. Listing order is random. Jakob proposed replacing RNNs with self-attention and started\\nthe effort to evaluate this idea. Ashish, with Illia, designed and implemented the first Transformer models and\\nhas been crucially involved in every aspect of this work.

Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = ( z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2'),\n",

Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors.

The input consists of\\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q, K, V ) = softmax( QK T\\n√dk\\n)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof 1√dk\\n. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1√dk\\n.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively.

For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0 , xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512 , and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndf f = 2048.\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n5'),\n",

To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nP E(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel)\\nP E(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel)\\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k, P Epos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nP Epos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈ Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations.

To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in\\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\nor O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [ 18], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models.

Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3 Optimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [20] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ = 10 −9. We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate = d−0.5\\nmodel · min(step_num−0.5, step_num · warmup_steps−1.5) (3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup_steps training steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number.

We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting,\\nusing the larger high-confidence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences\\n[37]. We used a vocabulary of 16K tokens for the WSJ only setting and a vocabulary of 32K tokens\\nfor the semi-supervised setting.\\nWe performed only a small number of experiments to select the dropout, both attention and residual\\n(section 5.4), learning rates and beam size on the Section 22 development set, all other parameters\\nremained unchanged from the English-to-German base translation model.

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor.\\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\nReferences\\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

The Transformer replaces traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with self-attention layers, allowing for more parallelization and faster training times. The model is tested on machine translation tasks and achieves state-of-the-art results on the WMT 2014 English-to-German and English-to-French translation tasks. The paper also explores the application of the Transformer to other tasks, such as English constituency parsing, and demonstrates its ability to generalize well. The Transformer's self-attention mechanism is visualized, showing that it can capture long-distance dependencies and perform tasks such as anaphora resolution. Overall, the paper presents a new and efficient architecture for sequence-to-sequence tasks, with potential applications in natural language processing and other areas.\"}"

      "Speech:The speech introduces a research paper titled \"Attention Is All You Need\" by Google researchers. The paper proposes a new neural network architecture called the \"Transformer\" that relies solely on attention mechanisms, eliminating the need for recurrent or convolutional neural networks. The authors claim that this new architecture is simpler and potentially more effective than existing models. The speech also provides attribution and permission for others to reproduce tables and figures from the paper for journalistic or scholarly purposes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech proposes a new network architecture called the \"Transformer\" that relies solely on attention mechanisms, eliminating the need for recurrence and convolutions. The model is tested on two machine translation tasks and achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming existing models while being more parallelizable and requiring less training time. The Transformer also generalizes well to other tasks, such as English constituency parsing, and achieves high-quality results with both large and limited training data. Key achievements include:\n",
      "\n",
      "* 28.4 BLEU score on English-to-German translation task\n",
      "* 41.8 BLEU score on English-to-French translation task\n",
      "* Training time of only 3.5 days on eight GPUs\n",

      "\n",
      "The speech appears to be an acknowledgement section of a research paper. The authors are giving credit to each other for their contributions to the development of the Transformer model. They mention that they applied the Transformer to English constituency parsing with success, and highlight the key contributions of each team member, including designing and implementing the model, proposing new ideas, and experimenting with variants. The team worked together to evaluate and refine the model, with each member playing a crucial role in its development.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech appears to be an acknowledgement section, likely from a research paper. It mentions that Lukasz and Aidan worked on designing and implementing tensor2tensor, which improved results and accelerated research. The work was performed at Google Brain and Google Research, and the paper was presented at the 31st Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2017).\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech introduces the topic of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), specifically long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent neural networks, which have become state-of-the-art approaches in sequence modeling and transduction problems like language modeling and machine translation. However, the sequential nature of RNNs limits their ability to be parallelized, which becomes a problem when dealing with long sequences due to memory constraints. This sets the stage for recent work that aims to address these limitations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the limitations of sequential computation in modeling sequences, particularly at longer sequence lengths. It highlights recent improvements in computational efficiency, but notes that the fundamental constraint of sequential computation remains. The speech then introduces the Transformer model, which proposes a new approach by relying entirely on attention mechanisms to model dependencies, eliminating the need for recurrent networks. This approach aims to overcome the limitations of traditional sequential computation methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech proposes a new model architecture called the \"Transformer\" that uses an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output, allowing for more parallelization and achieving state-of-the-art translation quality in just 12 hours of training. It also mentions other models, such as Extended Neural GPU, ByteNet, and ConvS2S, which use convolutional neural networks to reduce sequential computation, but notes that these models have limitations in terms of relating signals from different positions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the limitations of certain sequence-to-sequence models, such as ConvS2S and ByteNet, which struggle to learn dependencies between distant positions in a sequence. In contrast, the Transformer model reduces this problem to a constant number of operations, although it can lead to reduced effective resolution. The speech also highlights the effectiveness of self-attention mechanisms, which have been successfully used in various tasks such as reading comprehension and abstractive summarization. Additionally, it mentions end-to-end memory networks, which use a recurrent attention mechanism. Overall, the speech discusses the challenges and solutions in sequence-to-sequence modeling.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses recent advancements in natural language processing models, specifically the Transformer model. It highlights that the Transformer is the first model to rely entirely on self-attention to compute input and output representations, without using traditional sequence-aligned recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or convolution. The speech also mentions that the Transformer has an encoder-decoder structure, where the encoder maps input sequences to continuous representations, and the decoder generates an output summary based on these representations. The goal of the speech is to describe the Transformer model, explain the motivation behind self-attention, and discuss its advantages over other models.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses a sequence-to-sequence model where an encoder maps input symbols to continuous representations, and a decoder generates output symbols one at a time, using previously generated symbols as input.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech describes the architecture of the Transformer model, specifically the encoder and decoder stacks. The key points are:\n",
      "\n",
      "* The encoder consists of 6 identical layers, each with 2 sub-layers: a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a fully connected feed-forward network.\n",
      "* Each sub-layer has a residual connection and layer normalization.\n",

      "\n",
      "Overall, the speech provides a technical overview of the Transformer model's architecture, focusing on the encoder and decoder stacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the architecture of a model, specifically the decoder and attention components. Here's a summary:\n",
      "\n",
      "* The model has a decoder composed of 6 identical layers, each with 3 sub-layers: two similar to the encoder and one that performs multi-head attention over the encoder's output.\n",
      "* The decoder uses residual connections and layer normalization, similar to the encoder.\n",
      "* The self-attention sub-layer in the decoder is modified to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions, ensuring that predictions at position i only depend on known outputs at positions less than i.\n",
      "* The attention function is described as mapping a query and key-value pairs to an output, but the details of this function are not fully explained in the provided text.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the concept of an attention function, which takes in a query and a set of key-value pairs and produces an output vector. The output is calculated as a weighted sum of the input values.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses two types of attention mechanisms: Scaled Dot-Product Attention and Multi-Head Attention. \n",
      "\n",
      "Scaled Dot-Product Attention is a type of attention where the input consists of queries, keys, and values. The attention weight is calculated by taking the dot product of the query and key, dividing by the square root of the key's dimension, and then applying a softmax function. This is done for multiple queries simultaneously by packing them into matrices.\n",
      "\n",
      "The formula for this is: Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^T / √dk) * V, where Q, K, and V are matrices of queries, keys, and values respectively. \n",
      "\n",
      "Multi-Head Attention, on the other hand, consists of multiple attention layers running in parallel.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses attention functions, specifically two types: additive attention and dot-product (multiplicative) attention. The dot-product attention is described by the equation Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^T / √dk) * V. The main points are:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Dot-product attention is similar to additive attention but faster and more space-efficient due to optimized matrix multiplication.\n",
      "* Additive attention performs similarly to dot-product attention for small values of dk, but outperforms it for larger values of dk.\n",
      "* The speaker's algorithm uses dot-product attention with a scaling factor of 1/√dk.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses two topics related to attention mechanisms in neural networks:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Dot Product Attention**: For large values of `dk`, the dot products can grow large, causing the softmax function to have extremely small gradients. To counteract this, the dot products are scaled by `1/√dk`.\n",
      "2. **Multi-Head Attention**: Instead of using a single attention function, the queries, keys, and values are linearly projected `h` times with different learned projections, and attention is applied in parallel to each projected version, yielding `dv`-dimensional outputs.\n",
      "\n",
      "This approach helps to improve the performance of attention mechanisms, especially for larger models.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the concept of multi-head attention in the Transformer model. It explains that multi-head attention allows the model to attend to different representation subspaces at different positions, which is not possible with a single attention head. The multi-head attention mechanism is defined as:\n",
      "\n",
      "MultiHead(Q, K, V) = Concat(head1, ..., headh)WO\n",
      "\n",
      "where each head is a separate attention mechanism with its own set of projections. The speech also mentions that the model uses 8 parallel attention layers (or heads) with reduced dimensionality, which reduces the computational cost.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech then briefly touches on the applications of attention in the Transformer model, specifically mentioning that multi-head attention is used in three different ways, including \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers. However, the speech is cut off before providing further details on these applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses how the Transformer model uses multi-head attention in three ways:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Encoder-decoder attention**: The decoder attends to all positions in the input sequence (encoder output) to generate output.\n",
      "2. **Encoder self-attention**: Each position in the encoder attends to all positions in the previous encoder layer.\n",
      "3. **Decoder self-attention**: Each position in the decoder attends to all positions in the decoder up to and including that position, but with a restriction to prevent leftward attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "These attention mechanisms allow the model to weigh the importance of different input positions when generating output.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the architecture of a neural network, specifically the encoder and decoder components. It highlights two key aspects:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Self-attention layers in the decoder**: These layers allow each position in the decoder to attend to all previous positions, while preventing leftward information flow to maintain the auto-regressive property. This is achieved by masking out illegal connections in the scaled dot-product attention mechanism.\n",
      "2. **Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks (FFN)**: Each layer in the encoder and decoder contains a fully connected feed-forward network, applied separately and identically to each position. The FFN consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between, using the same linear transformations but different parameters across positions. The FFN is defined by the equation: FFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech appears to be discussing a neural network architecture, specifically a transformer model. Here's a summary:\n",
      "\n",
      "* The model uses a feed-forward network (FFN) with two linear transformations and a ReLU activation function.\n",
      "* The model has an input and output dimension of 512, and an inner layer dimension of 2048.\n",
      "* The model uses learned embeddings to convert input and output tokens to vectors.\n",
      "* The embedding layers and pre-softmax linear transformation share the same weight matrix.\n",
      "* The model uses a softmax function to convert decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the speech is describing the architecture of a transformer model, including its feed-forward network, embedding layers, and output probabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the complexity and efficiency of different layer types in a neural network model, specifically:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Self-Attention**: High complexity, but low sequential operations and maximum path length.\n",
      "2. **Recurrent**: Medium complexity, high sequential operations, and maximum path length.\n",
      "3. **Convolutional**: Medium complexity, low sequential operations, and medium maximum path length.\n",
      "4. **Restricted Self-Attention**: Low complexity, low sequential operations, and medium maximum path length.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech also mentions the importance of **positional encoding** in the model, as it lacks recurrence and convolution. Positional encoding is added to the input embeddings to provide information about the relative or absolute position of tokens in the sequence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the use of \"positional encodings\" in a neural network model. To help the model understand the sequence of input tokens, positional encodings are added to the input embeddings. The speech explains that the authors used a specific type of positional encoding, which involves sine and cosine functions of different frequencies, to represent the position of each token in the sequence. This choice was made to allow the model to easily learn to attend to relative positions in the sequence. The authors also experimented with using learned positional embeddings, but found that their chosen method was effective.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the use of self-attention layers in sequence transduction models. The authors experimented with two types of positional embeddings (sinusoidal and learned) and found similar results, choosing the sinusoidal version for its potential to extrapolate to longer sequence lengths. The authors then justify their use of self-attention layers by considering three key factors: \n",

      "1. Computational complexity per layer\n",
      "2. The amount of computation that can be parallelized\n",
      "3. The minimum number of sequential operations required.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. Self-attention mechanisms, used in state-of-the-art models, can be computationally expensive for long sequences. To improve performance, the speech suggests restricting self-attention to a neighborhood of size \"r\" around each output position, which could increase the maximum path length.\n",

      "2. Convolutional layers, another approach, also have limitations. A single layer cannot connect all input and output positions, and multiple layers are needed to achieve this, which increases computational cost.\n",

The paper proposes a new neural network architecture called the \"Transformer\" that relies solely on attention mechanisms. The Transformer model has shown promising results in machine translation tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results and outperforming existing models.\\n\\nThe key points of the summary include:\\n\\n1. The Transformer model eliminates the need for recurrent or convolutional neural networks.\\n2. The model uses multi-head attention, self-attention mechanisms, and positional encoding.\\n3. The model has been shown to be effective in various natural language processing tasks, including machine translation and English constituency parsing.\\n4. The model has been tested on various tasks and has achieved high-quality results, with significant improvements in computational efficiency and parallelization.\\n\\nThe summary highlights the advantages of the Transformer model, including its ability to be parallelized, reduced training time, and ability to handle long-range dependencies. The model has been evaluated on various tasks, including English-to-German and English-to-French translation tasks, and has achieved state-of-the-art results.\\n\\nThe summary concludes by highlighting the potential of the Transformer model for other tasks, such as handling images, audio, and video, and making generation less sequential.

      "The authors propose a new neural network architecture, called the Transformer, which relies solely on attention mechanisms, eliminating the need for recurrent or convolutional neural networks. To preserve sequence order information, the model utilizes positional encoding, specifically using sine and cosine functions of different frequencies, adding relative or absolute position information to the input embeddings. This choice was made over learned positional embeddings, as it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than those encountered during training. The Transformer architecture has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results in machine translation tasks, such as English-to-German and English-to-French translation, while also being more parallelizable and requiring less training time due to its ability to minimize sequential operations. Additionally, the Transformer has demonstrated its ability to generalize well to other tasks, including English constituency parsing, where it achieves good results even in small-data regimes. A key advantage of the Transformer is its ability to handle long-range dependencies more efficiently, with self-attention layers connecting all positions with a constant number of sequentially executed operations, unlike recurrent layers which require O(n) sequential operations, allowing the model to learn long-range dependencies with shorter path lengths. Furthermore, in terms of computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers, particularly for long sequences, making the Transformer a more efficient architecture. As an added benefit, the self-attention mechanism can also provide more interpretable models, with individual attention heads learning to perform different tasks and exhibiting behavior related to the syntactic and semantic structure of sentences.

      "The authors propose a new neural network architecture, called the Transformer, which relies solely on attention mechanisms, eliminating the need for recurrent or convolutional neural networks. To preserve sequence order information, the model utilizes positional encoding, specifically using sine and cosine functions of different frequencies, adding relative or absolute position information to the input embeddings. This choice was made over learned positional embeddings, as it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than those encountered during training. The Transformer architecture has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results in machine translation tasks, such as English-to-German and English-to-French translation, while also being more parallelizable and requiring less training time due to its ability to minimize sequential operations. Additionally, the Transformer has demonstrated its ability to generalize well to other tasks, including English constituency parsing, where it achieves good results even in small-data regimes, outperforming previously reported models with the exception of the Recurrent Neural Network Grammar, and surpassing the Berkeley Parser even when trained only on a limited dataset. A key advantage of the Transformer is its ability to handle long-range dependencies more efficiently, with self-attention layers connecting all positions with a constant number of sequentially executed operations, unlike recurrent layers which require O(n) sequential operations, allowing the model to learn long-range dependencies with shorter path lengths. Furthermore, in terms of computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers, particularly for long sequences, making the Transformer a more efficient architecture. As an added benefit, the self-attention mechanism can also provide more interpretable models, with individual attention heads learning to perform different tasks and exhibiting behavior related to the syntactic and semantic structure of sentences. Moreover, the model benefits from increased size and the use of dropout to avoid over-fitting. The authors have achieved a new state of the art on both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014 English-to-French translation tasks, with their best model outperforming all previously reported ensembles in the former task. The code for training and evaluating the models is available, and future research plans include applying attention-based models to other tasks and modalities, such as images, audio, and video, as well as investigating local attention mechanisms and making generation less sequential.\n",

Additionally, the Transformer has demonstrated its ability to generalize well to other tasks, including English constituency parsing, where it achieves good results even in small-data regimes, outperforming previously reported models with the exception of the Recurrent Neural Network Grammar, and surpassing the Berkeley Parser even when trained only on a limited dataset. A key advantage of the Transformer is its ability to handle long-range dependencies more efficiently, with self-attention layers connecting all positions with a constant number of sequentially executed operations, unlike recurrent layers which require O(n) sequential operations, allowing the model to learn long-range dependencies with shorter path lengths. Furthermore, in terms of computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers, particularly for long sequences, making the Transformer a more efficient architecture. As an added benefit, the self-attention mechanism can also provide more interpretable models, with individual attention heads learning to perform different tasks and exhibiting behavior related to the syntactic and semantic structure of sentences. Moreover, the model benefits from increased size and the use of dropout to avoid over-fitting. The authors have achieved a new state of the art on both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014 English-to-French translation tasks, with their best model outperforming all previously reported ensembles in the former task. The code for training and evaluating the models is available, and future research plans include applying attention-based models to other tasks and modalities, such as images, audio, and video, as well as investigating local attention mechanisms and making generation less sequential.\n",

       " 'output_text': 'The provided context appears to be an illustration of the attention mechanism in the Transformer model, specifically showing how different attention heads learn to perform distinct tasks related to the structure of a sentence. However, this context does not add any significant new information to refine the existing summary. Therefore, the original summary remains unchanged.\\n\\nThe authors propose a new neural network architecture, called the Transformer, which relies solely on attention mechanisms, eliminating the need for recurrent or convolutional neural networks. To preserve sequence order information, the model utilizes positional encoding, specifically using sine and cosine functions of different frequencies, adding relative or absolute position information to the input embeddings. This choice was made over learned positional embeddings, as it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than those encountered during training. The Transformer architecture has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results in machine translation tasks, such as English-to-German and English-to-French translation, while also being more parallelizable and requiring less training time due to its ability to minimize sequential operations. Additionally, the Transformer has demonstrated its ability to generalize well to other tasks, including English constituency parsing, where it achieves good results even in small-data regimes, outperforming previously reported models with the exception of the Recurrent Neural Network Grammar, and surpassing the Berkeley Parser even when trained only on a limited dataset. A key advantage of the Transformer is its ability to handle long-range dependencies more efficiently, with self-attention layers connecting all positions with a constant number of sequentially executed operations, unlike recurrent layers which require O(n) sequential operations, allowing the model to learn long-range dependencies with shorter path lengths. Furthermore, in terms of computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers, particularly for long sequences, making the Transformer a more efficient architecture. As an added benefit, the self-attention mechanism can also provide more interpretable models, with individual attention heads learning to perform different tasks and exhibiting behavior related to the syntactic and semantic structure of sentences. Moreover, the model benefits from increased size and the use of dropout to avoid over-fitting. The authors have achieved a new state of the art on both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014 English-to-French translation tasks, with their best model outperforming all previously reported ensembles in the former task. The code for training and evaluating the models is available, and future research plans include applying attention-based models to other tasks and modalities, such as images, audio, and video, as well as investigating local attention mechanisms and making generation less sequential.'}"
