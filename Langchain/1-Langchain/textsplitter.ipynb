From this application the term digital computer has \\nemerged. \\n➢  In practice, digital computers function more reliably if only two states are used. Digital computers \\nuse the binary number system, which has two digits: 0 and 1. A binary digit is called a bit. \\n➢ Information is represented in digital computers in groups of bits. By using various coding \\ntechniques, groups of bits can be made to represent not only binary numbers but also other d iscrete \\nsymbols. \\n➢ In contrast to the common decimal numbers that employ the base 10 system, binary numbers use a \\nbase 2 system with two digits: 0 and I. The decimal equivalent of a binary number can be found by \\nexpanding it into a power series with a base of 2.  \\n➢ For example, the binary number 1001011 represents a quantity that can be converted to a decimal \\nnumber by multiplying each bit by the base 2 raised to an integer power as follows: \\n \\n➢ The seven bits 1001011 represent a binary number whose decimal equiv alent is 75. However, this \\nsame group of seven bits represents the letter K when used in conjunction with a binary code for the \\nletters of the alphabet.'),\n",

Once the computer \\nspecifications are formulated, it is the task of the designer to develop hardware for the system. \\nComputer design is concerned wit h the determination of what hardware should be used and how the \\nparts should be connected.

The individual bits can be distinguished as in (b). The numbering of bits in a \\n16-bit register can be marked on top of the box as shown in (c).

The symbol PC(0 -7) or PC(L) \\nrefers to the low-order byte and PC(S-15) or PC( H) to the high-order byte. \\n❖ Micropoeration: The operations executed on data stored in registers are called micro operations. \\n✓ A micro operation is an elementary operation performed on the info rmation stored in one  or \\nmore registers.  \\n✓ The result of the operation may replace the previous binary  information of a register or may \\nbe transferred to another register.  \\n✓ Examples of micro operations are shift, count, clear, and load. \\n❖ Register transfer language - The symbolic notation used to descri be the micro operation transfers \\namong registers is called a register transfer language.  \\n✓ The term \"register  transfer\" implies the availability of hardware logic circuits that can \\nperform a  stated micro operation  and transfer the result of the operation to the same or  \\nanother register. \\n✓ A register transfer language is a system for expressing in  symbolic form the micro operation \\nsequences among the registers of a digital module. \\n❖ Information transfer from one register to another is designated in symbolic form by means of a \\nreplacement operator. \\n The statement \\nR2 \\uf0dfR1 \\ndenotes a transfer of the content of register R1 into register R2. It designates a replacement of the \\ncontent of R2 by the content of R l . By definition, the  content of the source register R1 does not \\nchange after the transfer \\n❖ Normally, we want the transfer to occur only under a predetermined control condition. This can be \\nshown by means of an if-then statement. \\n            If (P = 1) then (R2 \\uf0df R1)          /* Register transfer with control function */ \\n                   Where P is a control signal generated in the control section \\n✓ A control function is a Boolean variable that is  equal to 1 or 0.

For example, \\noutput 1 of register A is connected to input 0 of MUX 1 because this input is labeled A1. \\n \\n➢ The diagram shows that the bits in the same significant position in each register  are connected to \\nthe data inputs of one multiplexer to form one line of the bus.  Thus MUX 0 multiplexes the four 0 \\nbits of the registers, MUX 1 multiplexes the four 1 bits of the registers, and similarly for the other \\ntwo bits. \\n➢ The two selection lines S1 and S0 are connected to the selection inputs of all four multiplexers.  \\n✓ The selection lines choose the four bits of one register  and transfer the m into the four -line \\ncommon bus.  \\n✓ When S1S0 = 00, the 0 data inputs of all four multiplexers  are selected and applied to the \\noutputs that form the bus.  \\n✓ This causes the bus lines to receive the content of register A since the outputs of this register \\nare c onnected to the 0 data inputs of the multiplexers. Similarly, register B is selected if \\nS1S0 = 01, and so on. \\n➢ Table I-C shows the register that is selected by the bus for each of the four possible binary value \\nof the selection lines \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n              Table I-C: Function Table for Bus of Fig. I-B \\nNOTE: In general, a bus system will multiplex k registers of n bits each to produce an n -line common \\nbus. The number of multiplexers needed to construct the bus is equal to n , the number of bits i n each \\nregister. The size of each multiplexer must be k x 1 since it multiplexes k data lines. For example, a \\ncommon bus for eight registers of 16 bits each requires 16 multiplexers, one for each line in the bus. \\nEach multiplexer must have eight data input  lines and three selection lines to multiplex one significant \\nbit in the eight registers.'),\n",

This is because INPR receives a character from an input device which is then transferred to \\nAC. OUTR receives a character from AC and delivers it to an output device. \\n➢ The 16 lines of the common bus receive information from six registers and the memory unit. The bus \\nlines are connected to the inputs of six registers and the memory. \\n➢ Five registers have three control inputs: LD (load), INR (increment) and CLR (clear).

Two registers have only a LD input. \\n➢ The input data and output data of the memory are connected to the common bus, but the memory \\naddress is connected to AR. Therefore, AR must always be used to specify a memory address. \\n➢ The content of any register  can be specified for the memory data input during a write operation. \\nSimilarly, any register can receive the data from memory after a read operation except AC. \\n➢ The 16 inputs of AC  come from an adder and logic circuit. This circuit has three sets of inputs. One \\nset of 16 -bit inputs come from the outputs of AC. They are used to implement register micro -\\noperations such as complement AC and shift AC. \\n➢ Another set of 16 -bit inputs come from the data regis ter DR. The inputs from DR and AC are used \\nfor arithmetic and logic micro-operations, such as add DR to AC or and DR to AC. \\n➢ The result of an addition is transferred to AC and the end carry -out of the addition is transferred to \\nflip-flop E (extended AC bit).

The result of the operation is transferred to AC. The micro \\noperations that execute this instruction are: \\nD0T4 : DR ← M [AR] \\nD0T5: AC ← AC Λ DR, SC ← 0 \\n• Two timing signals are needed to execute the instruction. The clock transition associated with timing \\nsignal T4 transfers the operand from memory into DR.  \\n• The clock transition associated with the next timing signal T5 transfers to AC the result of the AND \\nlogic operation between the contents of DR and AC.  \\n• The same clock transition clears SC to 0, transferring control to timing signal T0 to start a new \\ninstruction cycle. \\n2) ADD to AC \\nThe instruction adds the content of the memory word specified by the effective address to the value of \\nAC. The sum is transferred into AC and the output carry C out is transferred to the E (extended \\naccumulator) flip-flop. The micro operations needed to execute this instruction are: \\nD1T4: DR ← M [AR] \\nD1T5: AC ← AC + DR, E ← Cout, SC ← 0 \\nThe same two timing signals, T4 and T5, are used again but with operation decoder D1 instead of D0.  \\n3) LDA : Load to AC \\nThis instruction transfers the memory word specified by the effective address to AC. The micro \\noperations needed to execute this instruction are: \\nD2T4: DR ← M [AR] \\nD2T5: AC ← DR, SC ← 0 \\n• From the bus diagram we note that there is no direct path from the bus into AC.  \\n• The adder and logic circuit receive information from DR which can be transferred into AC.  \\n• Therefore, it is necessary to read the memory word into D R first and then transfer the content of DR \\ninto AC. \\n4) STA : Store AC \\nThis instruction stores the content of AC into the memory word specified by the effective address. \\nSince the output of AC is applied to the bus and the data input of memory is connected to the bus, \\nwe can execute this instruction with one micro operation: \\nD3T4: M [AR] ← AC, SC ← 0'),\n",

The next instruction is then fetched and executed from the  \\nmemory address given by the new value in PC. \\n6) BSA : Branch and Save Return Address \\n• This instruction is useful for branching to a portion of the program called a subroutine or procedure. \\nWhen executed, the BSA instruction stores the address of the next inst ruction in sequence (which is \\navailable in PC) into a memory location specified by the effective address. \\n• The effective address plus one is then transferred to PC to serve as the address of the first instruction \\nin the subordinate. This operation was specified in Table 1-5 with the following register transfer: \\nM [AR] ← PC, PC ← AR + 1 \\n❖ An Example: Demonstrates how BSA instruction is used with a subordinate is shown in  \\nFig. 1-J. The BSA instruction is to be in memory at address 20. The I bit is 0 and the address part of \\nthe instruction has the binary equivalent of 135.  \\n❖ After the fetch and decode phases, PC contains 21, which is the address of the next instruction in the \\nprogram (referred to as the return address). \\n❖ AR holds the effective address 135. This is shown in part (a) of the figure. The BSA instruction \\nperforms the following numerical operation: \\nM[135] ← 21, PC ← 135 + 1 = 136 \\n❖ The result of this operation is shown in part (b) of the figure. The return address 21 is stored in \\nmemory location 135 and control continues with the subordinate program starting from address 136. \\n❖ The return to the original program (at address 21) is accomplished by means o f an indirect \\nBUN instruction placed at the end of the subroutine.  \\n❖ When this instruction is executed, control goes to the indirect phase to read the effective address at \\nlocation 135, where it finds the previously saved address 21.'),\n",

The bus is used at T5 to transfer the content of AR to PC. \\n \\n \\n7) ISZ : Increment and Skip if Zero \\n❖ This instruction increment the word specified by the effective address, and if the incremented value \\nis equal to 0, PC is incremented by 1.  \\n❖ The programmer usually stores a negative number (in 2’s complement) in the memory word.
